<p>"When your mother has grown older,<br>
When her dear, faithful eyes<br>
no longer see life as they once did,<br>
When her feet, grown tired,<br>
No longer want to carry her as she walks<br>
</p>
<p>
Then lend her your arm in support,<br>
Escort her with happy pleasure.<br>
The hour will come when, weeping, you<br>
Must accompany her on her final walk.<br>
</p>
<p>
And if she asks you something,<br>
Then give her an answer.<br>
And if she asks again, then speak!<br>
And if she asks yet again, respond to her,<br>
Not impatiently, but with gentle calm.<br>
</p>
<p>
And if she cannot understand you properly<br>
Explain all to her happily.<br>
The hour will come, the bitter hour,<br>
When her mouth asks for nothing more.<br>
</p>
